            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p> This work focuses on the challenge of quadrupedal locomotion in terrains that require precise foothold planning and foot placement. We demonstrate that a control
                policy capable of tracking desired footholds to navigate stairs, slopes, obstacles,
                and stepping stones can be effectively learned in simulation using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and successfully deployed on a real robot to track footholds
                generated by a model-based controller. During training, the reference footholds are
                computed based on the policyâ€™s value function and a simple kinematic model, which
                replaces the model-based controller and significantly reduces the training time. </p>
